- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Primarily because Hooks are new and surely we will have to work with legacy pre-hook-class-component-code.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Mounting- beginning of lifecycle, component is initially rendered. This is where event-listeners are set up and initial data is fetched.
Updating/re-rendering- where changes are monitored and re-rendered as changes to state or props etc, occur. This is the bulk of the life cycle and where most of actions take place. Like useEffect hook
Unmounting- end of life cycle, where clean-up if side-effects occurs and Component is removed from the DOM

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

To reuse and combine blocks of stateful logic for DRY, efficient, clean code.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

It is important to test so that we can ensure that our app works under a variety of circumstances that a user may encounter. It serves as documentation, helps in early identification of problems and aids in debugging. It also keeps us thinking  from the userâ€™s perspective and edge cases that our app may encounter. Rigorous testing reduces manual testing, makes maintaining the code easier and cheaper and more stable.
